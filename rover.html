  <h1>Chandrayaan 3 Control</h1>
  <p>Pl. note: You have to input direction in which TOP of spacecraft initially points along with the initial FRONT direction.</p>
  <p>Assumption: The spacecraft turns 90 deg towards the direction in which it's top points at that time when command 'u' is given.</p>
  <p>The spacecraft turns 90 deg opposite to the direction in which it's top points at that time when command 'd' is given.</p>
  <p>You can see the spacecrafts position, direction of FRONT and TOP after every command in the browser's console output.</p>
